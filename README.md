1. **What it's Vuln Or Vulnerability** : which refers to a vulnerability, weakness, or security gap in a computer system, network, or application. In the IT world, a vulnerabilities refers to system weaknesses that attackers can exploit to infiltrate, steal data, or damage the system.

2. **How can I know That's Website It's Vulnerability** : Website vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a site's code, configuration, or infrastructure that could allow attackers to exploit them, such as injecting malicious code, stealing data, or gaining unauthorized access. Common types include SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and misconfigurations. Knowing these helps in securing your own site or assessing risks ethically.

Important Note: Always ensure you have explicit permission to test any website. Unauthorized scanning or testing can be illegal (e.g., violating laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US). Focus on your own sites or use legal platforms like bug bounty programs (e.g., HackerOne, Bugcrowd) where testing is encouraged.
